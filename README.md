In this classwork, we create a database and two tables with values of products for customers to purchase.  
Customers have the ability to view and purchase the itema they choose. 
A manager has ability to view the inventory, add items to the table as well as change the price or quantity of the inventory.

Second table will be for supervisor.  This table will have information as departments and their overhead costs. Supervisor will be able to view and adjust the overhead cost and operation.
